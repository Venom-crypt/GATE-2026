## SETS OPERATIONS

**Union:** A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
**Intersection:** A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
**Complement:** A' = {x | x ∉ A}
**Cardinality:** |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

---

## FUNCTIONS

**Types:**
- **Injective:** f(a) = f(b) ⟹ a = b (one-to-one)
- **Surjective:** For all b ∈ B, ∃a ∈ A: f(a) = b (onto)
- **Bijective:** Both injective and surjective (one-to-one correspondence)

**Inverse exists iff bijective**

---

## COMBINATORICS

**Permutations:** P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!
**Combinations:** C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!)
**Note:** C(n,r) = C(n, n-r) (symmetry)

**Recurrence Relation Example:**
```
Fibonacci: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), F(0)=0, F(1)=1
Closed form: F(n) = (φ^n - ψ^n)/√5 where φ=(1+√5)/2
```

## GRAPH THEORY BASICS

**Connected Graph:** Path exists between all vertex pairs
**Complete Graph K_n:** All vertices connected to all others (n(n-1)/2 edges)
**Bipartite:** Vertices in 2 disjoint sets, edges between sets only
**Chromatic Number:** Minimum colors for proper coloring

**Handshaking Lemma:** Σ degree(v) = 2|E|

## LINEAR ALGEBRA

### Determinant (2×2)
```
det([a b]) = ad - bc
    [c d]
```

### Determinant (3×3) - Rule of Sarrus
```
det([a b c])
    [d e f] = aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - afh - bdi
    [g h i]
```

### System of Linear Equations
```
Ax = b
- Unique solution: rank(A) = rank(A|b) = n
- Infinite solutions: rank(A) = rank(A|b) < n
- No solution: rank(A) < rank(A|b)
```

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
```
1. Solve: det(A - λI) = 0 (characteristic equation)
2. For each λ: Solve (A - λI)v = 0
3. Non-zero v is eigenvector
```

### Diagonalization
```
If A has n linearly independent eigenvectors:
A = PDP^(-1)
P = [v₁ v₂ ... vₙ] (eigenvectors as columns)
D = diag(λ₁, λ₂, ..., λₙ) (eigenvalues on diagonal)
```

## CALCULUS

### Derivatives - Chain Rule
```
If y = f(u) and u = g(x):
dy/dx = (dy/du)(du/dx) = f'(g(x))·g'(x)
```

### Derivatives - Product Rule
```
(uv)' = u'v + uv'
```

### Derivatives - Quotient Rule
```
(u/v)' = (u'v - uv')/v²
```

### Common Derivatives
| f(x) | f'(x) |
|------|-------|
| x^n | nx^(n-1) |
| e^x | e^x |
| ln(x) | 1/x |
| sin(x) | cos(x) |
| cos(x) | -sin(x) |
| tan(x) | sec²(x) |

### Maxima and Minima
```
1. Find critical points: f'(x) = 0
2. Second derivative test:
   - f''(x) < 0: Local maximum
   - f''(x) > 0: Local minimum
   - f''(x) = 0: Inconclusive
3. Check endpoints for absolute extrema
```

### Integration by Parts
```
∫u dv = uv - ∫v du
```

### Integration by Substitution
```
∫f(g(x))g'(x)dx = ∫f(u)du where u = g(x)
```

## PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

### Normal Distribution N(μ, σ²)
```
PDF: f(x) = (1/(σ√(2π))) exp(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))
Mean = μ
Variance = σ²
68-95-99.7 Rule: 68% within σ, 95% within 2σ, 99.7% within 3σ
```

### Binomial Distribution B(n, p)
```
PMF: P(X = k) = C(n,k) p^k (1-p)^(n-k)
Mean = np
Variance = np(1-p)
```

### Poisson Distribution
```
PMF: P(X = k) = (λ^k e^(-λ))/k!
Mean = λ
Variance = λ
(Approximates Binomial when n large, p small, np = λ)
```

### Exponential Distribution
```
PDF: f(x) = λe^(-λx), x ≥ 0
Mean = 1/λ
Variance = 1/λ²
Memoryless property: P(X > s+t | X > s) = P(X > t)
```

### Uniform Distribution U(a,b)
```
PDF: f(x) = 1/(b-a) for a ≤ x ≤ b
Mean = (a+b)/2
Variance = (b-a)²/12
```

## STATISTICS

**Mean:** μ = Σx_i/n
**Variance:** σ² = Σ(x_i - μ)²/n (population) or (n-1) (sample)
**Standard Deviation:** σ = √variance

**Normal Distribution Parameters:**
- μ = mean (location)
- σ = standard deviation (spread)
- σ² = variance

## CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY & BAYES

**Conditional Probability:**
```
P(A|B) = P(A∩B)/P(B)
```

**Multiplication Rule:**
```
P(A∩B) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)
```

**Total Probability Law:**
```
P(B) = Σ P(B|A_i)P(A_i)
```

**Bayes' Theorem:**
```
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)
```

**Bayes with Total Probability:**
```
P(A_i|B) = P(B|A_i)P(A_i) / [Σ P(B|A_j)P(A_j)]
```

## DISCRETE MATH - RELATIONS

**Relation Properties:**
- **Reflexive:** (a,a) for all a ∈ A
- **Symmetric:** (a,b) ⟹ (b,a)
- **Transitive:** (a,b) ∧ (b,c) ⟹ (a,c)
- **Antisymmetric:** (a,b) ∧ (b,a) ⟹ a = b

**Equivalence Relation:** Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive
**Partial Order:** Reflexive + Antisymmetric + Transitive

## GROUPS AND MONOIDS

**Monoid:** Set with associative binary operation and identity element
**Group:** Monoid where every element has inverse

## FORMULAS TO MEMORIZE

**Variance:** Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])²
**Covariance:** Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
**Correlation:** ρ = Cov(X,Y)/(σ_X σ_Y)

**Taylor Series:** f(x) = Σ f^(n)(a)(x-a)^n/n!
**L'Hôpital's Rule:** lim(x→a) f(x)/g(x) = lim(x→a) f'(x)/g'(x)
